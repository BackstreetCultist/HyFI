Problem files given in form of SATLIB/DIMACS format (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html)
Preamble contains n lines beginning with c which are comments,
followed by one line beginning with p which describes the problem

Problem line contains two numerical variables.
    1st - number of variables
    2nd - number of clauses
Extant variables are 1-n (there is no 0 var)
    So we'll need to give all indexes as +1

A clause line is a number of variables followed by a zero
    I don't know what the zero is for
If a variable is preceeded by a minus sign,
that variable is negated in the clause
