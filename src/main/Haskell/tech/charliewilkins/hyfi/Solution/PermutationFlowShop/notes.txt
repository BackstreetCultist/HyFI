Folder address in form n*m
    n is the number of jobs
    m is the number of machines
So first folder contains examples with 100 jobs on 20 machines

m-1 lines with n words followed by 1 much longer line
"The job processing times on all instances are uniformly distributed random integers in the range [1,99]"
So in line m, word [n] indicates the time job n will take on machine m

But what is the bottom line for?

37s
[25,75,71,15,14,60,23,92,12,54,26,52,42,67,40,10,24,24,42,20] -> 788 (768 is start of last machine)

Need to check if running the last job on the first machine results in the sum of the first machine
	I think it should with any s
