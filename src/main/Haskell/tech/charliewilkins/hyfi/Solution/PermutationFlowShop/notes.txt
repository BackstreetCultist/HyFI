Folder address in form n*m
    n is the number of jobs
    m is the number of machines
So first folder contains examples with 100 jobs on 20 machines

m-1 lines with n words followed by 1 much longer line
"The job processing times on all instances are uniformly distributed random integers in the range [1,99]"
So in line m, word [n] indicates the time job n will take on machine m

But what is the bottom line for?
