The following files represent an example Problem Module (PM) for HyFI.

The first task in creating a Problem Module is to define the types you will use.
The Types.hs file contains two sets of types, the first of which (which are
complete) should not be edited, as the Problem Layer will expect them as they
are here. The second incomplete set must be completed by you.

The next task is to create multiple effective Operators, Acceptors and
Evaluators. A heuristic will only ever be as good as its components, and a wide
field to select from will improve the performance of the Genetic Algorithm. The
maximum number of components that HyFI can 'handle' is as follows:
    - 8 Acceptors
    - 8 Evaluators
    - 8 sets of 8 Operators

Finally, the PM may be completed by filling out each of the incomplete functions
found in the Main.hs module. Once you have done all of this, you will have a
complete Problem Module that can be loaded and run by HyFI.

Thank you for choosing HyFI, and happy hacking!
