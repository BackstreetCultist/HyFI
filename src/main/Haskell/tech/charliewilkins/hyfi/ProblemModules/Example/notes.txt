The following files represent an example Problem Module (PM) for HyFI.

Throughout the module, you will find a number of functions and types whose
definitions are incomplete. By filling these out, a working PM will have been
created. These functions are the ones which are exposed to the Solution.Main
module, allowing the PM to be run.

The next task is to create multiple effective Operators, Acceptors and
Evaluators. A heuristic will only ever be as good as its components, and a wide
field to select from will improve the performance of the Genetic Algorithm. The
maximum number of components that HyFI can 'handle' is as follows:
    - 8 Acceptors
    - 8 Evaluators
    - 8 sets of 8 Operators

Thank you for choosing HyFI, and happy hacking!
